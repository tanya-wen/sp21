    "In a famous (or infamous) survey, members of the Harvard medical school were asked to consider a scenario in which \"a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is 1/1,000 has a false positive rate of 5 percent\". The terminology, the specific question asked in the survey, and the answer, are discussed in detail in a Stat 88 textbook [section](http://stat88.org/textbook/notebooks/Chapter_02/04_Use_and_Interpretation.html#Harvard-Medical-School-Survey) that you are strongly encouraged to read. As Stat 88 is a Data 8 connector course, the section is another look at the same ideas as in the corresponding [Data 8 textbook section](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/18/2/Making_Decisions.html).\n",

In this exercise you will use the `hist` function in `matplotlib` instead of the corresponding `Table` method to draw histograms.\n",

    "Define a function `integer_distribution` that takes an array of integers and draws the histogram of the distribution using unit bins centered at the integers and white edges for the bars. The histogram should be drawn to the density scale. The left-most bar should be centered at the smallest integer in the array, and the right-most bar at the largest.\n",

    "#### Question 5b) ####\n",
    "In Data 8 you studied the Supreme Court case of [Swain versus the State of Alabama](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/1/Assessing_Models.html), where a question before the Court was whether a jury panel of size 100 had been selected at random from a population in which 26% of the people were black. That was the percent of black people in the population that was eligible to serve on the panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `np.random.multinomial` to simulate drawing at random with replacement from a categorical distribution. The arguments are the sample size `n` and an array `pvals` of the proportions in all the categories. The function simulates `n` independent random draws from the distribution and returns the observed counts in all the categories. Read the documentation to see how this is described formally; we will use the formal terminology and notation in future assignments after we have discussed them in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that the function also takes a third argument `size`, which for our purposes will be an integer that specifies the number of times to run the entire simulation. All the runs are independent of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write one line of code that uses `np.random.multinomial` to run 10 independent simulations of drawing 100 times at random with replacement from a population in which 26% of the people are black. The output should be an array containing the counts in the black category in the 10 simulations. It will help to recall how to slice `NumPy` arrays. Assign your answer to the variable `sample`.\n",

    "Redraw your histogram from Part **c** and overlay the normal curve with $\\mu = 26$ and $\\sigma$ equal to the choice you made in Part **d**. You just have to call `plt.plot` after `integer_distribution`. Use `np.e` for $e$. For the curve, use 2 as the line width, and any color that is easy to see over the blue histogram. It's fine to just let Python use its default color.\n",
